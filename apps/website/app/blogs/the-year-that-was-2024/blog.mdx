## The Problem: What Sparked the Journey?

Building exceptional developer tools is never straightforward, especially in a rapidly evolving ecosystem like React Native. In early 2024, we paused and asked ourselves a critical question: _What do developers truly need?_

The State of React Native Survey provided a detailed glimpse into the ecosystem's landscape. gluestack emerged as a standout in the Styling and UI Component Libraries categories, establishing its relevance and reliability for developers worldwide.

This recognition served as a catalyst, driving our commitment to build solutions that are functional, intuitive, scalable, and future-ready. With this momentum, gluestack's journey to reshape the developer experience took flight.

The results were eye-opening. Despite being the new entrant, **gluestack-ui** ranked impressively high among UI component libraries:

- **69% of users** expressed a willingness to use gluestack-ui again.
- **52% of users** showed significant interest.

This was more than validation—it was the momentum we needed. The potential was clear, but so were the challenges waiting on the horizon.

## The Struggle: Growing Pains with gluestack v1

Every great journey comes with its share of obstacles; for us, that was **gluestack v1**. While it aimed to simplify React Native development, real-world usage revealed performance issues that could not be overlooked.

Our team worked tirelessly, tweaking the architecture and optimizing components, but the results fell short of expectations. The blazing-fast, efficient experience developers needed remained out of reach. It became clear: fixing v1 was not enough. We needed a radical shift.

That's when we discovered **NativeWind**, a framework gaining momentum in the React Native ecosystem. Its promise of performance optimization and seamless styling capabilities offered more than a solution—it was an opportunity to rebuild our foundation with modern principles.

By early 2024, **NativeWind** had surpassed **65k weekly downloads** on npm, proving its popularity and reliability. For us, the choice was clear: it was time to rebuild gluestack with NativeWind at its core.

This decision was not about patching up old issues—it was about reimagining what gluestack could become.

## The Idea: Shifting Gears to Build Something Better

The writing was on the wall: v1's challenges could not be resolved with quick fixes. The solution required something bigger, smarter, and future-proof.

That's when **NativeWind** entered the picture. With its utility-first styling and seamless performance integration, it wasn't just making waves—it was setting a new standard in the ecosystem.

For the gluestack team, this marked a turning point. We envisioned a better future—one where our tools would be leaner, faster, and more reliable. Shifting to a **NativeWind-based architecture** meant rethinking everything: performance, accessibility, and usability.

This was not about fixing problems anymore. It was about giving developers the tools they needed to innovate, thrive, and shape the future of app development.

## The Solution: gluestack v2 Is Born

After months of ideation, rebuilding, and rigorous testing, gluestack v2 was launched, setting a new benchmark in performance and design.

This new version addressed the limitations of its predecessor with faster load times, optimized components, and a smoother developer experience, making it a reliable and efficient tool for developers. Powered by NativeWind, it brought the simplicity of Tailwind's utility classes to React Native, enhancing customization and ensuring consistency across platforms.

The transition from NativeBase's prop-based APIs to gluestack v2's compound APIs provided a more cohesive and flexible interface, empowering developers with greater control and adaptability.

To elevate design collaboration, we introduced a brand-new [Figma design file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1358053104938234615/gluestack-ui-v2-0-design-kit), featuring customizable components and tokens. This design kit not only facilitated seamless collaboration between developers and designers but also ensured visual consistency across projects.

The shift from v1 to v2 wasn't merely an improvement—it marked the beginning of a new era. With stronger foundations, innovative features, and a clear focus on empowering developers, gluestack v2 is poised to transform how user interfaces are built.
