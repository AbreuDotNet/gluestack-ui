# Tooling Setup

## IntelliSense setup (optional)

If you are using VSCode and the [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss), you have to add the following to your `settings.json` file.

```js

  {
    "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
      ["tva\\((([^()]*|\\([^()]*\\))*)\\)", "[\"'`]([^\"'`]*).*?[\"'`]"]
    ]
  }

```

## Prettier plugin setup (optional)

If you are using [prettier-plugin-tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss) to sort your class names, you can add tv to the list of functions that should be sorted (on `.prettierrc`).

```jsx
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['prettier-plugin-tailwindcss'],
  tailwindFunctions: ['tva'],
};
```
