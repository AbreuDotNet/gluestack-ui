# Server-side rendering (SSR)

Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique that enables the rendering of web pages on the server before sending them to the browser. SSR can help improve the performance of web applications by reducing the time it takes for the first page to load, enhancing SEO, and improving accessibility.

gluestack-ui components are built on top of React Native Web and `@gluestack-style/react`, and can be rendered server-side using Next.js or any other server-side rendering framework.

However, for more advanced server-side rendering scenarios, such as with Next.js, some configuration may be necessary. In these cases, you may need to install and configure additional packages, such as next-transpile-modules, to ensure that the gluestack-ui components are properly transpiled and available for server-side rendering.

To use gluestack-ui components with server-side rendering, you need to configure your project to transpile the modules correctly. The easiest way to do this is by using the withGluestackUI Next.js adapter. This adapter adds the necessary configuration to your project to ensure that your gluestack-ui components are transpiled correctly for server-side rendering.
