## Themed

Following is the default implementation of the **LinearGradient** component without any additional customization. This serves as a starting point for users who are new to this library and want to learn about the basic functionality and appearance of the component.

<AppProvider>
  <CodePreview
    showComponentRenderer={true}
    showArgsController={false}
    metaData={{
      code: `
<LinearGradient  colors={['$purple400', '$red400']} p="$5">      
  <Text color="white">
    This is a Box
  </Text>
</LinearGradient>
`,
      transformCode: (code) => {
        return transformedCode(code);
      },
      scope: {
        Wrapper,
        Text,
        LinearGradient,
      },

#### Button with Linear Gradient

A Box component with a ref property enables the direct reference and manipulation of the underlying DOM element, offering greater control and flexibility in modifying the box's appearance and behavior within a user interface.

<AppProvider>
  <CodePreview
    showComponentRenderer={true}
    showArgsController={false}
    metaData={{
      code: `
          <LinearGradient
      colors={['$purple400', '$red400']}
      borderRadius="$full"
      p="$4"
    >
      <Pressable>
        <Icon as={EditIcon} color="$white" />
      </Pressable>
    </LinearGradient>
      `,
      transformCode: (code) => {
        return transformedCode(code);
      },
      scope: {
        Wrapper,
        Pressable,
        Icon,
        EditIcon,
        LinearGradient,
      },
      argsType: {},
    }}
  />
