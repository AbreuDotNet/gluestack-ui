## Advanced

We provide in-depth information on how to customize and extend the component's functionality to meet your needs. Below, we describe how to modify the component to suit your requirements.

### Customizing the Badge

For customizing the Badge, you have to map styled view to Badge. You can refer [style.gluestack.io](https://style.gluestack.io/) for more information on how to use styled components.

#### Usage

Default styling of the component can be found in the `components/core/badge` file. For reference, you can view the [source code](https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/tree/development/example/storybook/src/ui-components/Badge) of the styled `Badge` component.

```jsx
// import the styles
import { Root, Text, Icon } from '../components/core/badge/styled-components';

// mapping the Badge to root component and compounding the Text and Icon components
const Badge = Root;
Badge.Text = Text;
Badge.Icon = Icon;

// Using the badge component
export default () => (
  <Badge>
    <Badge.Text></Badge.Text>
    <Badge.Icon></Badge.Icon>
  </Badge>
);
```
