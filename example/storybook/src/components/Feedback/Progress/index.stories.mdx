## Advanced

We provide in-depth information on how to customize and extend the component's functionality to meet your needs. Below, we describe how to modify the component to suit your requirements.

### Customizing the Progress

For customizing the Progress, you have to map styled view to Progress. You can refer [dank.style](https://dank.style/) for more information on how to use styled components.

#### Usage

Default styling of the component can be found in the `components/core/progress` file. For reference, you can view the [source code](https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/blob/development/example/storybook/src/components/Progress/index.tsx) of the styled `Progress` component.

```jsx
// import the styles
import {
  Root,
  FilledTrack,
} from '../components/core/progress/styled-components';

// import the createProgress function
import { createProgress } from '@gluestack-ui/progress';

// Understanding the API
const Progress = createProgress({
  Root,
  FilledTrack,
});

// Using the Progress component
export default () => (
  <Progress>
    <Progress.FilledTrack />
  </Progress>
);
```
