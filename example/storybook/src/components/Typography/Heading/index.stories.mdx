## Advanced

### Customizing the Heading

For customizing the Heading, you have to map styled view to Heading. You can refer [dank.style](https://dank.style/) for more information on how to use styled components.

#### Usage

Default styling of the component can be found in the `components/core/heading` file. For reference, you can view the [source code](https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/blob/development/example/storybook/src/ui-components/Heading/index.tsx) of the styled `Heading` component.

```bash
// import the styles
import { Root } from '../components/core/heading/styled-components';

// mapping the Heading to root component
const Heading = Root;

// Using the heading component
export default () => (
  <Heading>
    <Text />
  </Heading>
);
```
