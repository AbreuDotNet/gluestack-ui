# Introduction

gluestack-ui is a React library of universal, unstyled, and accessible components, designed for easy integration into web and mobile applications. With keyboard accessibility and focus management features, it's a great choice for developers who prioritize accessibility and usability.

we believe that creating accessible and user-friendly user interfaces should be easy for developers. However, we noticed that many existing UI libraries require a lot of customization to meet accessibility standards and often lack the performance required for mobile applications. To address this, we built gluestack-ui, a library of universal, unstyled, and accessible components that can be easily customized and integrated into any web or mobile application.

## Why we built gluestack-ui?

gluestack-ui originally started as part of NativeBase, a universal component library for both React and React Native. However, we realized that not everyone needs all the components from NativeBase, so we broke it down into three separate libraries:

- [dank.style](https://dank.style) - The high-performing and universal CSS-in-JS library.
- [ui.gluestack.io](https://ui.gluestack.io) - Universal, unstyled, and accessible components that adds accessibility to low-level [dank.style](https://dank.style) components or any component with the same prop type. You can even customize the components as desired.=

## But aren’t React Native and React Native Web sufficient?

gluestack-ui and React Native Web aren’t directly comparable as they are different.

While React Native and React Native Web can be used to create cross-platform applications, they require developers to write platform-specific code and to customize their components for accessibility and performance. gluestack-ui provides a different approach by offering a set of universal, unstyled, and accessible components that work seamlessly on both web and mobile platforms.

By using gluestack-ui, developers can create accessible and user-friendly interfaces with a consistent design language without worrying about the underlying platform. The focus on accessibility and performance means that developers can achieve a high level of usability with minimal effort.

React Native Web is great! gluestack-ui needs React Native Web’s “components” to build universal components.

gluestack-ui builds upon the React Native Web components by adding accessibility props, focus management, and other functionality to ensure that the components are accessible and performant.

## Why use gluestack-ui, when we already have NativeBase?

gluestack-ui was originally part of NativeBase, but it has since evolved into a standalone library focused solely on accessibility. Unlike NativeBase, which is a complete component library that includes styling, accessibility, and a default theme, gluestack-ui focuses specifically on accessibility.

While NativeBase provides a comprehensive solution for building web and mobile applications, dank offers a more streamlined and flexible solution for managing styles in your projects. This makes dank a complementary tool for developers who are already using NativeBase, or for those who want to focus specifically on styling without the added complexity of a full component library.

## Goals

- Accessibility: gluestack-ui aims to provide a set of accessible components that work across different platforms and devices. The components come with accessibility features such as ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and focus management.

- Consistency: gluestack-ui provides a consistent design language across different platforms, making it easier to build interfaces that look and feel the same on different devices.

- Ease of use: gluestack-ui components are designed to be easy to use and customizable, with clear and concise APIs that make it simple to integrate them into existing projects.

## Non goals

- Theming: gluestack-ui does not provide an out-of-the-box theming system. While the components can be customized using style props, the library does not offer a theme provider or a pre-built set of themes. (check dank.style)

- Flexibility: gluestack-ui components are designed to work in a specific way and may not be suitable for all use cases. The library is not intended to be a one-size-fits-all solution, and developers may need to build their own components or use other libraries for certain use cases.

- Design

- Animation (check examples with Legend-Motion)

## Future Considerations:

- gluestack-ui is committed to continuously expanding its library of components to meet the needs of developers.
- In the future, we plan to add more components to the library, such as navigation, combobox, and accordion.
- Our goal is to provide a comprehensive set of accessible and customizable components for building web and mobile applications.

  Please note that these features are not part of the current roadmap, but are being actively considered for future development.
