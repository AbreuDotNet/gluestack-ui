# Figma Kit

### Agenda:

Auto-generating Figma Kit for gluestack-ui Design System from Storybook

### Approach:

**Step 1: Storybook to Next**

- Create individual pages for each component in Next.js.
- Render all components with their various combinations, including variants and other properties.
- Implement server-side rendering (SSR) to capture the styling and layout in the page source.

**Step 2: Next to Figma**

- Fetch the Document Object Model (DOM) for each component from the Next.js pages.
- Generate Figma layers by traversing the DOM structure.
- Utilize the Figma API to create a Figma file with the generated layers.
- Create color and style tokens based on the Gluestack configuration.
- Map these tokens to the design in Figma.
- Convert the Figma layers into reusable components.
- Incorporate the instances of these components in compound components.
- Address any design issues or inconsistencies.
- Implement auto-layout support for responsive designs.
- Integrate dark mode support.
- Utilize Figma variables where applicable.
