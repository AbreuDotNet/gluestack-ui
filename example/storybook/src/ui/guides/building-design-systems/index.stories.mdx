# Building Design Systems

Use `gluestack-ui` to build your own collection of components that match your vision, and deploy across projects.

## Step 1: Create Your Own Package

To build your own design system, you can directly **fork** [`gluestack-ui`](https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui) and begin shaping your design system upon this foundation.

This includes :
- A component library package `@gluestack-ui/themed` in `packages/themed` directory.
- A theme package `@gluestack-ui/config` in `packages/config` directory.
- A storybook for both React and React Native in `example/storybook` directory.

Follow these steps after **forking** this repository:

### Change library name

- Navigate to the `packages/themed` and open `package.json`. (You can rename the folder if you need).
- Locate the `name` field in the `package.json` file and update it to `@myapp/components`.

  ```json
  //package.json
  {
    "name": "@myapp/components"
    // ...
  }
  ```

  Now your library `@myapp/components` has all primitive components from `@gluestack-ui/themed` by default.

- Similarly, Navigate to the `packages/config` and open `package.json`. (You can rename the folder if you need).
- Locate the `name` field in `package.json` file and update it to `@myapp/config`.

  ```json
  //package.json
  {
    "name": "@myapp/config"
    // ...
  }
  ```

  Now your library `@myapp/config` has all primitive components from `@gluestack-ui/config` by default.

### Update storybook configuration

Navigate to the `example/storybook` and make updates to the specified files below.

- **_tsconfig.json_**:

  You'll need to update `paths` in `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript import resolution.

  ```jsx
  // ... other configuration
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
      "paths": {
        "@myapp/components": ["../../packages/themed/src"],
        "@myapp/config": ["../../packages/config/src/gluestack-ui.config"],
      },
      // ...
  }
  ```

- **_babel.config.js_**:
  You'll need to update `alias` in `babel.config.ts` file incase you've renamed the folder `packages/themed` or `packages/config`.
  ```jsx
  // ... other configuration
    plugins: [
         [
            'module-resolver',
            {
              alias: {
                '@gluestack-ui/themed': path.join(
                __dirname,
                '../../packages/<component-folder-name>/src'
              ),
              }
            },
          ]
    ],
  // ... other configuration
  ```

## Step 2: Customize Tokens and Components

### Theme Tokens

Theme tokens and other configuration is present in `packages/config/src`. You have the flexibility to modify these tokens as per your requirements.

Check [this](/ui/docs/theme-configuration/customizing-theme) for more details.

### Components

You can customize the styling of all primitive components by modifying styling in `packages/config/src/theme/<ComponentName>.ts/` for a particular component. You may add and modify property value and variants based on your need.

**Create a custom component**
To create your own custom component. You need to follow these steps:

1. Create a folder inside `packages/themed/src/components/Circle`
2. Create a folder `styled-components/` inside `packages/themed/src/components/Circle` to keep components.
3. Create a styled component using `@gluestack-style/react` in `Root.tsx`. This will be an unstyled component initially with just component name.

```jsx
export const Root = styled(View, {}, { componentName: 'Circle' });
```

5. For other functionalities like accessibility and events, create an `index.tsx` file `packages/themed/src/components/Circle/index.tsx` and export it.

```jsx
import { Root } from './styled-components';

const Circle = (props) => {
  return <Root {...props}>{props.children}</Root>;
};
```

6. Export from `packages/themed/src/components/index.tsx`

```jsx
// other components
export * from './Circle';
```

7. Now we will define theme for `Circle` inside `packages/config/src/theme/Circle.ts`.

```jsx
import { createStyle } from '@gluestack-style/react';

export const Circle = createStyle({
  alignItems: 'center',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  borderRadius: '$full',
  overflow: 'hidden',
  variants: {
    size: {
      large: {
        width: 100,
        height: 100,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

8. Export from `packages/config/src/index.ts`

```jsx
// other components
export * from './Circle';
```

## Step 3: Test Your Package

Now you can import and test your component.

```jsx
import { Circle } from '@myapp/components';
export default () => <Circle size="large" />;
```

## Step 4: Publish Your Package

Publish your design system as a package from `packages/themed` and theme package from `packages/config`.

## Step 5: Integrate it in Your App

Once published, you can use `@myapp/components` in your app you need add it to your `package.json` and update your configuration.

#### Next.js

Update **_next.config.js_**:

```jsx
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const { withGluestackUI } = require('@gluestack/ui-next-adapter');

const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  transpilePackages: ['@myapp/components', '@myapp/config'],
};

module.exports = withGluestackUI(nextConfig);
```

#### Expo

No need to update any config for Expo.
